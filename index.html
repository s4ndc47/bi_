            Recently, a rare positive development emerged in the fight against drug overdoses: the number of overdose deaths decreased in 2023. This is a hopeful sign that the long and tumultuous journey of the opioid crisis might be shifting in a better direction.

            Since 2014, drug overdose deaths have spiked, recording exponential growth. The main cause behind this surge is the emergence of a new type of drug—Fentanyl. Compared to traditional drugs like heroin, cocaine, and morphine, Fentanyl is easier and less costly to produce, has a higher probability of causing addiction, and carries a significantly higher overdose risk.

            Originally developed as a pain reliever for cancer treatment, Fentanyl's illicit use began when it was mixed with heroin and sold on the Canadian drug market. It was then smuggled into the US, often undetected, via mail services. Nowadays, there is a transpacific production chain for Fentanyl, with producers primarily located in China.

            In the fight against Fentanyl, the CDC first noticed a significant increase in overdose deaths caused by the drug in 2013. The first public institution to take action was the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which issued a nationwide alert about Fentanyl as a threat to health and public safety. However, it wasn't until March 2018 that the DEA classified Fentanyl as a Schedule I drug, effectively banning its manufacture, distribution, and possession. Despite these efforts, over 100,000 people have died from Fentanyl overdoses.

            On the international level, the fight against Fentanyl has faced several setbacks, as no country paid sufficient attention to the global Fentanyl production chain. Some, particularly China, evaded their responsibilities regarding the problem. The deterioration of bilateral relations between the US and China has also been a major obstacle in disrupting the global Fentanyl production chain. However, in 2023, after a meeting between President Biden and President Xi, the two countries resumed cooperation in combating the global production and circulation of Fentanyl.

            Domestically, Fentanyl test strips have been made available for individuals to detect the presence of Fentanyl in substances. However, the application of these test strips faces significant challenges, as some states have banned their usage. The public and policymakers need to review their actions to address the Fentanyl overdose crisis effectively.
